# Background-Color-Changer-Responsive-Buttons
# HTML
I created HTML file and directly write h1 , img and p tags because the project was small and I don't have to create divs instaed of only one
That one div I created because I have added 4 spans
Gave them same class, different id and same functions (but in different names to be targeted background colors)
# CSS
Styling the whole page quickly and also height was 20 as well as width
text align right because most of the websites containing right side to change the background colors
# JavaScript
Select the function and give the value
change the whole background color
give the text class to h1 and p tag in HTML
Builting a logic in if and for of loops
if the user click on the black button the text color will be white
If the user click on the white button the text color will be black
